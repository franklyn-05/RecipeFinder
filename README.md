# RecipeFinder
Recipe finder is an app that allows users to connect via their love of food creation. Users can post recipes for others to view, like and comment on. Your favourite recipes can be shared
for use at a later time with the collections feature. You can also follow your favourite food creators to easily view their latest recipes.

## Motivation
This project was created as a group project for my Web App Development class in year 2 of University of Glasgow. We spent the most of a semester designing, building and presenting 
this application which was awarded an 'A' grade.

## Technology
This application was designed using Django, as this was the tech stack we were learning for this course. We combined python for our backend, building views, models, urls etc, with a frontend 
that was composed of HTML templates and CSS/JS for styling and interactivity. Specifically, BootStrap was used for CSS styling.
